# OpenSim-Skin-Attachment
base on Pose2Sim


1. Introduction
OpenSim is a free and open-source software developed by Stanford University for developing, analyzing, and visualizing human musculoskeletal systems. It has broad applications in fields such as gait dynamics analysis, sports performance research, surgical procedure simulation, and medical device design. In OpenSim, a musculoskeletal model consists of multiple bones connected by joints, with muscles attached to the bones. These muscles generate forces to drive joint motion. Currently, OpenSim is utilized by hundreds of biomechanics laboratories worldwide for movement research and is supported by an active developer community that continuously improves its functionality.

However, the default models generated by OpenSim do not include skin, requiring users to manually add it.

一、简介
OpenSim 是斯坦福大学开发的用于开发、分析和可视化人体肌肉骨骼系统的免费开源软件。它能应用在很多领域，如行走动力学分析、运动表现研究、手术过程仿真、医疗器械设计等。在OpenSim中，一个肌肉骨骼模型是由各个关节把多块骨骼连接起来，其中肌肉附着在骨骼上，通过肌肉产生的力来带动关节运动。目前OpenSim 被用于全球上百个生物力学实验室的运动研究，并拥有一个活跃的开发者社区来不断完善其功能。

但是，OpenSim生成的模型中默认不带有皮肤，因此需要我们去手动添加

2. Example (Body) Section
The file used to compile the OpenSim skeletal model is in .osim format, which is written in a manner similar to XML, analogous to the way HTML is used in front-end development.

二、示例(Body)部分
编译Opensim骨骼模型的文件为.osim格式，其写法类似于前端的HTML语言的xml语言
